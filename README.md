# RavelCAPI
C/C++-language binding for Ravel

(Ravel)[https://ravelation.hpcoders.com.au] is an interactive tool for exploring multidimensional datasets. This project provides a C and C++ API for the libravel dynamic library, that uses the common C ABI to avoid any compiler ABI inconsistencies. The dynamic loader supplied here will perform a version check to ensure that the libravel is a compatible version.
